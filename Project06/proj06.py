# Description:
# Creates a program to manage zoos with a menu and several details
# prompts user to ask expenses and the number of the zoos
# enter the zoos name
# reads the files
# gives the users 4 options
# one to display which zoo is the healthiest
# one to display which zoo is the most expensive
# one to show each zoos individual information
# one to allow the program to be quit
