# Computer Project 07
#
#
# This program is a simulation of the card game UNO.
# The program will create a deck of UNO cards and shuffle them.
# The program will start by displaying a banner
# The user will be prompted to enter the number of players (2-5) and the game will begin.
# Each player will be dealt 5 cards from the deck.
# the game consists of special cards such as Skip, Reverse, +2, Wild, and Wild Draw Four that can change the play
# the user will either play a card from their hand or draw a card from the deck.
# The game will continue until a player has no cards left in their hand.
# The user will be prompted to play another round or exit the game.
